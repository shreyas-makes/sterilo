# Sterilo - Portable UV-C Steriliser


## Background & Need
- For ensuring that the procedures used to treat COVID-19 are risk free in terms of viral/bacterial contamination, hospitals normally follow disinfection/sterilisation methods. Disinfection methods involving NaClO and alcohol wipes which are still inefficient against bacterial spore formation and with most of the viruses. Besides, the hospital staff directly come in contact with these surfaces during treatment, leading to a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission.

- For sterilisation procedures in ICUs and Isolation wards, fumigation and autoclave treatment are the most commonly used methods. However, with autoclaves, there are so many high exposure contact points that dont fit into the standard size of the enclosure. Beside there is also water droplet formation after usage which requires another round of drying treatment before reuse in the hospitals. As the total duration takes around 1 hour, during an increased surge of patients especially during this COVID-19 crisis, the autoclave would exceed its batch processing capability.

- The fumigation process also requires extensive time (48 hours is the medically accepted standard). Currently in most of the Indian hospitals, the operations resume 30 minutes after the fumigation which renders the treatment partially effective thereby increasing the viral load in ICUs and hospital wards.

### Lack of enough autoclaves to sterilise instruments

SARS-CoV-2,the virus causing COVID-19, survives in the environment, including on surfaces of various materials such as iron, cardboard and tissue. This explains that there is a risk that the outer surface of respirators and surgical masks used inpatient care can quickly become contaminated.

### Need for reuse of Personal protective equipment

Due to lack of enough personal protection equipment, they are beginning to be reused without any sterilization. Medical staff in teams 1 and 2 are still not provided with PPEs and have only N95 masks, like any other sanitary workers. They donâ€™t have high viral loads like the teams 3 (who treat less severe patients) and 4 (who treat ICU patients) There is an imminent shortage of Personal Protective Equipments (PPE) even for teams 3 and 4 which includes masks, aprons, gowns and eye protection gear for the health workers in hospitals across India. Owing to this, they are facing a higher risk of virus infection, accidentally exposing other patients, their own families, and their colleagues at a time when hospitals cannot afford to have critical personnel on the sidelines. Contamination of the surface of respirators and surgical masks entails a risk for infection when reusing a mask or respirator without proper sterilization

### Medical guidelines

- Confirmed patients are arranged in the same room with bed spacing of not less than 1.2 meters (appx 4 feet).
- Disinfection of object surfaces: Surfaces wiped with 1000 mg/L chlorine-containing disinfectant or wipes with effective chlorine; wait for 30 minutes and then rinse with clean water. Repeated 3 times a day. First cleaner (less touched) regions are disinfected, followed by contaminated areas. Each time a surface is wiped, the used wipe is replaced with a new one


### Effectiveness of UV-C on N95 masks

- Use is shown to be effective against SARS (SARS-COV) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340400179X

# Solution

UV-C, although being a standardised technology for killing bacteria and viruses is commonly not used in medical practise owing to the risk of exposure to human beings. By ensuring the safety of users through the design, and by also leveraging the UV-C technology, we allow the adoption of this technology in medical environments. The portable UV-C steriliser is open-source, low-cost and is DIY friendly, allowing makers to deploy locally in their communities using basic tools.

This product is a valuable asset to sterilise most of the contact points for patients and health care workers in hospitals which includes oximeters, contact thermometers, N95 masks, touch points such as door handles, plugs, sockets, buttons of control units such as portable X-ray machines, echo machine controls for cardiac patients etc and even surgical equipments such as scissors, shears, tongs and so on.

For usage, the object is placed on top of the mesh within the box enclosure for 30 minutes of exposure to render it effective for reuse. The design illuminates the whole surface, thereby preventing any shadowing effects to take place. Even for objects that dont directly fit into the enclosure of the UV-C steriliser, the design allows it to be placed onto the object helping in proper sterilisation of the surface.

Helps sterilise the following categories of objects:

- Oximeters: In isolation wards, for severe cases of patients with heart ailments, who also belong to the high risk category of COVID-19, they are monitored with oximeters
- Thermometers: At present, most of the hospitals avoid contactless thermometers because of its inaccuracy, and still rely on normal thermometers which might have more chances of being exposed to a viral load owing to it coming to contact with the COVID-19 patients.
-  N95 Masks: Flow rates drop 1.2 percent every time it is sterilised. However, when there is a shortage of N95 masks, it could be recommended to use the N95 masks after sterilisation. However the life cycle of the N95 masks have to be taken into consideration. (Currently in the hospitals, the doctors go through 6 hour shifts four times a day i.e after every six hour shift, they would need to either reuse the N95 mask or get a new one)
-  Door handles, plugs, sockets (which normally dont fit into an autoclave), surgical equipments such as scissors, clamps, tongs etc
- Buttons of commonly used control units such as portable X-ray machines, breathing unit controls, echo-machine control for cardiac patients and so on.
